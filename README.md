# Motivation-Hub
JBS Bootcamp Group 14 motivation hub backend

This project is one of the two projects that my group & I were tasked to build at the end of the JBS Bootcamp.
We were tasked to build a Python motivation hub that will allow the user to create, view, like,  and comment on a motivational post and store it in a text or CSV file.
The motivation hub will provide a platform for users to interact with the motivational messages and manage them easily.
I was responsible for developing the code for the backend of the motivation hub, where the posts created by the users will be stored, viewed, liked, and commented on. 
My teammate was responsible for developing the frontend of the application.
